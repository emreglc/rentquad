This thesis describes the design and implementation of a self-driving quadricycle rental platform that provides a contactless user experience through a mobile app, cloud backend, and connected vehicle electronics. The project addresses the growing need for safe micro-mobility solutions in urban areas where users need to find, unlock, and return shared vehicles without staff assistance. The system uses an Expo React Native client, Supabase for authentication and data management, and embedded modules on the quadricycle for telemetry and remote control.

The work covers requirement analysis, system architecture, and a complete rental flow that handles reservations, QR code scanning for ride start, live trip tracking, and automatic payment processing. The implementation uses reusable hooks for managing rental states, secure session handling with local storage, and a spatial database for tracking vehicle locations on the map. Testing showed that the system works as intended and provides a practical foundation for deploying autonomous quadricycle services in the future.
